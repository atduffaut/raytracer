# First-Hit Raytracer

## Building and Compilation:

1. Install MacPorts https://www.macports.org/install.php

2. Install glew, glfw, and eigen3 using MacPorts, the following commands:
   'sudo port install glew'
   'sudo port install glfw'
   'sudo port install eigen3'

3. Include 'opt/local/include' when compiling, and link 'opt/local/lib'
   These are the locations that MacPorts automatically installs libraries

4. Note .vscode/tasks.json for the full compilation command
